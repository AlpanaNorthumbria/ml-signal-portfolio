I specialise in signal processing and machine learning for real-world sensing systems, with a focus on audio and physiological signals, 
multimodal learning, and deployable ML pipelines. My work spans academic research, industry-scale systems, and early-stage startup-style prototyping, 
bridging theory with production-ready algorithms.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary Focus Areas:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

2. Temporal & dynamic modelling

3. Classification and phenotyping

4. Mobile-based data acquisition (Android & iOS)

5. Robust ML pipelines under real-world constraints

6. Research-to-product translation

Core Algorithmic Projects:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Multimodal COPD Phenotyping (PhD Research)

Domain: Audio signals | Clinical data
Methods: DSP, ML, Deep Learning, Multimodal Fusion

Designed end-to-end pipelines for cough sound analysis, spirometry features, electronic health record (EHR) data.

Extracted time–frequency features (MFCCs, spectral statistics, temporal dynamics) and trained GRU/LSTM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and energy-based models.

Built pre/post intervention (6MWT) comparative models to detect physiological change.

Focused on interpretability, intra-patient variability, and robustness under small datasets.




B. Signal Processing & Feature Engineering Toolkit

Domain:  Acoustic sensing 

Implemented reusable DSP modules for:

Noise reduction & segmentation

Time–frequency analysis

Feature stability analysis across sessions

Designed pipelines suitable for real-time or near-real-time inference.

Experience analysing signal quality and feeding insights back into data acquisition design.




C. Dynamic & Spatial Representations in Signals

Methods:

Temporal dynamics modelling

Spatial mode reasoning (inspired by Dynamic Mode Decomposition / PyDMD)

Sequence modelling with attention-based GRUs

Applied structured representations to capture latent physiological states, aligning signal dynamics with downstream classification and monitoring tasks.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Industry & Startup-Relevant Experience
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Production-Grade Design & Data Systems

Designed and deployed data pipelines and analytics systems for large, structured datasets in industry environments (IBM, Boeing, Infosys).

Experienced in delivering robust, maintainable code under real operational and reliability constraints.

Strong engineering background in Python and Java, with hands-on experience in microservices architectures, message queues (Kafka, MQ), and cloud-native deployment using Docker and Kubernetes.

B. Cross-Functional Collaboration

Worked closely with network/security-adjacent teams, clinicians, and academic–industry collaborators to translate real-world requirements.

Comfortable operating in fast iteration cycles, using agile workflows (Jira, Gantt-based planning) to validate assumptions, refine algorithms, and adapt to evolving technical and product constraints.
